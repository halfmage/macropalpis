### Reworking
Iam currently updating some classnames for the first major release of macropalpis.

# macropalpis.css
**v. 1.0** - A experimental CSS collection

### Approaches and Features
- Fast, tiny and responsive
- Collection of abstract css classes
- Tool for prototyping with the browser
- The quarks of Atomic Design
- Scalable system starting from .25em up to 16em
- CSS declarations as seperated class modules
- Mminimal, abstract and lazy naming convention
- Use of numeric/alphabetic suffixes (`ov ≠ o1`)

### Implementation
**Coming soon**

### Background Information
Paratarsotomus **macropalpis** is a species of mite. It is quite small — 0.7 mm — but has been recorded as the world's fastest land animal relative to body length. The mite has been recorded at a speed of 322 body lengths per second (0.225 metres per second (0.50 mph)).

Yes, this project is also highly inspired by [Tachyons by Adam Morse](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons). Which I really love.
