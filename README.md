### What is this?
Paratarsotomus macropalpis is a species of mite. It is quite small — 0.7 mm — but has been recorded as the world's fastest land animal relative to body length. The mite has been recorded at a speed of 322 body lengths per second (0.225 metres per second (0.50 mph)).

This project is also highly inspired by [Tachyons by Adam Morse](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons). Which I really love.
